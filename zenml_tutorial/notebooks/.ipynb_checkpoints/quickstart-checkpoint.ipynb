    "Before we dive into the code, let us briefly introduce you to some of the \n",
    "fundamental concepts of ZenML that we will use in this quickstart. If you are \n",
    "already familiar with these concepts, feel free to skip to the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "The first concept that we will cover is the ZenML **Step**. In \n",
    "ZenML, a step provides a simple python interface to our users to design a \n",
    "stand-alone process in an ML workflow. They consume input artifacts \n",
    "and generate output artifacts. As an example, we can take a closer look at a \n",
    "simple step example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from zenml.steps import step\n",
    "\n",
    "@step\n",
    "def my_dataset_loader() -> pd.DataFrame:\n",
    "    \"\"\"My dataset loader step.\"\"\"\n",
    "    # Implement logic here and return the dataset...\n",
    "    return ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the steps, you will go over the concepts of **Pipelines**. These \n",
    "pipelines provide our users a simple python interface to design their ML \n",
    "workflows by linking different steps together. For instance, a very \n",
    "simple pipeline might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from zenml.pipelines import pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "@pipeline\n",
    "def my_pipeline(\n",
    "    my_data_loader,\n",
    "    my_model_trainer,\n",
    "):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Load the dataset and train a model.\"\"\"\n",
    "    dataset = my_data_loader()\n",
    "    model = my_model_trainer(dataset=dataset)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stacks & Stack Components\n",
    "\n",
    "As for the execution of these pipelines, you need a **stack**. In ZenML, \n",
    "a stack stands for a set of configurations of your MLOps tools and \n",
    "infrastructure. Each stack consists of multiple **stack components** and\n",
    "depending on their type, these components serve different purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at some examples of different flavors of stack components, you \n",
    "will see examples such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Airflow**Orchestrator**]() which orchestrates your ML workflows on Airflow \n",
    "- [MLflow**ExperimentTracker**]() which can track your experiments with MLFlow\n",
    "- [Evidently**DataValidator**]() which can help you validate your data\n",
    "\n",
    "Any such combination of tools and infrastructure can be registered as a \n",
    "separate stack in ZenML. Since ZenML code is tooling-independent, you can \n",
    "switch between stacks with a single command and then automatically execute your\n",
    "ML workflows on the desired stack without having to modify your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Integrations\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, ZenML comes equipped with a wide variety of stack components flavors. \n",
    "While some of these flavors come built-in with the ZenML package, the others \n",
    "are implemented as a part of one of our integrations. Since our quickstart \n",
    "features some of these integrations, you will see a practical example on how \n",
    "to use these integrations in the upcoming sections."
